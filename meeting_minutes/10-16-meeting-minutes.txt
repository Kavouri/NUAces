Item: Discuss System Requirements
Who: Tighe Carroll, Alex Kavourias, Alek Piekarski, Austin McKenna, Joshua Michel
Notes:

- allow student faculty (cep coop) to also have admin accounts
- students dont have to check out perse
- reports wont be generated regularly, only once in a while (at request of service partners)
- service partners do not need to have access to this system at all
- Community partner involvement is not prioritized. I took this to mean that
  community partners do not need to be integrated into the system, as their only
  role is the verification of student involvement. This probably means we can
  just email them verification links in the future.
- Less concerned about the number of hours, and would prefer to see a task based
  system. They want to measure engagement via number of tasks completed. They
  don't want rote timesheets.
- 'Civic Log' not 'Timesheet'
- Administrators prefer that the system captures a snapshot of of student
  engagement, once again, *not* a rote timesheet that lists hours and numbers.
- There will likely be reflection questsions asked of students after they
  complete a task. This was not mentioned in previous engagements, and is a new
  requirement update.
- 3-5 admins at a time. Some will be students on coop.
- Yearly upload of student data.
